README - MinimalScalaXMPPComponent

This project demonstrates how to write an external XMPP component using the
Adirondack and Shellack libraries.  It also serves as a template you can
use to build you own component on. Recommended approach is to use github,
fork the project and rename it to your name, and then make your changes.
